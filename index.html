    <p>If you want someone with a different perspective, open mind and who challenges ideas outside the box. That’s me! That is my passion! That is my obsession! As a left-handed female Canadian designer, from Ottawa ON I enjoy exploring and adventuring into the deep realm of creative thinking and conceptual design.  Educated at Algonquin College for Graphic Design I am experienced in illustration - interactive design - web design - photography - logo design. “Creativity can solve almost any problem. The creative act, the defeat of habit by originality, overcomes everything.” -George Lois</p>
