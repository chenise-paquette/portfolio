<h1>Salt and Pepper - Logo Re-design/Re-brand</h1>
      
<div class="bio">
    <p>	The Salt and Pepper Express logo has been re-designed to give a
professional image that portrays their charismatic personality of their
restaurant.

        Adaptability is one word that could be used for the design of this
logo. It was re-designed to adapt to any vice and reproduce comfortably
in all ways. It is flexible in the sense that it is able to present it
self well at all sizes and shapes it is applied to.

        The saltshaker is a big part of the design of this logo. It represents the
generic demand of all use of food. It represents the amenity of food
and service. Within the shape of the saltshaker sits the initials of the
business name. This give the logo a dynamic feel because of the visually
pleasing negative and positive design. Also, this strategy helps
the name of this business be recognized with out the word mark.

        The work mark is clean, sleek and simple. The logo is so powerful
that the work mark can afford to be simplified. The watermark fits
the exact size of the logo making the logo and the watermark appear
and one piece. This strategy gives the logo in its entirety a very strong
appeal..</p>
