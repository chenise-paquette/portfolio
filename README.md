# **Chenise Summer Paquette**

If you want someone with a different perspective, open mind and who thinks way outside the box. Thatâ€™s me! That is my passion! That is my obsession! As a left-handed female Canadian designer, from Ottawa ON I enjoy exploring and adventuring into the deep realm of creative thinking and conceptual design.  Educated at Algonquin College for Graphic Design I am experienced in illustration - interactive design - web design - photography - logo design. Adult swim I want to work for yoooooouuuuu !
