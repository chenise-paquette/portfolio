<p>Hello. My name is Chenise Summer Paquette.
I am a left-handed female Canadian designer from Ottawa ON. 
I originally intended on being a professional photographer but through my studies I didn't feel creatively fulfilled. 
This realization lead me to exploring and adventuring into the deep realm of creative thinking and conceptual design. 
Educated at Algonquin College for Graphic Design I am experienced in illustration - interactive design - web design - photography - logo design. </p>
