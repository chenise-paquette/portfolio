<img alt="poster design - poster design ottawa" src="Images/Clients/Poster/poster.jpg"/>
<p>This is a event poster creation based on the Full Moon Party in Thailand. It was inspired by an exercise on using colour in graphic images. The image then turned into a unique piece that displays my personal style. Although the poster wasnâ€™t used I see it as a piece in my portfolio that displays bold and vibrant personality.</p>
